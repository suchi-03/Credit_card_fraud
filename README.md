# Credit_card_fraud

A machine learning-based pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset. The project included comprehensive data preprocessing steps such as scaling transaction amounts, handling missing values, and addressing class imbalance through undersampling and SMOTE techniques. Built and evaluated multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Developed a deployable solution by saving the trained model with ‘joblib’ for real-time prediction, enabling the identification of fraudulent transactions with high reliability. This system effectively addressed the challenges of imbalanced datasets and optimized model performance for fraud detection.
